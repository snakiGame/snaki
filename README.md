## 🚀 How to Play
1. **Swipe up**, **down**, **left**, or **right** to control the snake’s movement.
2. Eat the randomly appearing apples to grow your snake longer.
3. **The more apples you eat, the longer the snake gets**, increasing the challenge!
4. Avoid hitting the **walls** or your snake’s own body—do so, and it’s game over!
5. **Aim for the highest score** by eating as many apples as you can before crashing.
