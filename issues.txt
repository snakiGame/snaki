SNAKE GAME LOGIC ISSUES ANALYSIS
=====================================

## CRITICAL ISSUES:

### 1. Game Over Check Logic Flaw
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 88-96)
**Issue**: The game over check happens BEFORE the snake moves, but uses the current snake head position. This means:
- The check is performed with the old position, not where the snake is about to move
- The snake could move into a wall or itself and the collision wouldn't be detected until the next frame
**Fix needed**: Move the collision check after calculating the new head position.

### 2. Food Collision Detection Issues
**File**: utils/checkEatsFood.ts
**Issue**: The collision detection uses an `area` parameter (set to 2 in the game loop), but creates inconsistent behavior:
- Uses `<` comparison instead of `<=`, which could miss exact collisions
- The area-based detection might allow food to be eaten from a distance rather than requiring exact position overlap
**Fix needed**: Use exact position matching or fix the comparison logic.

### 3. Boundary Calculation Problem
**File**: hooks/useGame.ts (lines 21-26)
**Issue**: The game bounds calculation doesn't account for the actual game unit positioning:
```typescript
gameBounds: GameBounds = {
  xMin: 0,
  xMax: Math.floor((screenWidth - BORDER_WIDTH * 2) / GAME_UNIT_SIZE),
  yMin: 0,
  yMax: Math.floor((screenHeight - BORDER_WIDTH * 2) / GAME_UNIT_SIZE),
};
```
This could cause the snake to move beyond visible boundaries since the screen dimensions include status bars, headers, etc.
**Fix needed**: Calculate bounds relative to the actual game area, not screen dimensions.

## LOGIC FLOW ISSUES:

### 4. Food Spawning in Snake Body
**File**: utils/randomFoodPosition.ts
**Issue**: The `randomFoodPosition` function doesn't check if the new food position overlaps with the snake's body. This could spawn food inside the snake, making it impossible to reach.
**Fix needed**: Add collision check against snake body when spawning food.

### 5. Power-up Expiration Race Condition
**File**: hooks/useGameState.ts (lines 73-78)
**Issue**: Power-ups are checked for expiration using `useEffect`, but there's a potential race condition where the power-up could expire mid-calculation, leading to inconsistent game state.
**Fix needed**: Use a more deterministic approach for power-up expiration.

### 6. Gesture Handler Direction Logic
**File**: hooks/useGestureHandler.ts
**Issue**: The gesture detection might be too sensitive and could register unintended direction changes, especially on small swipes.
**Fix needed**: Add minimum swipe distance threshold and debouncing.

## PERFORMANCE ISSUES:

### 7. Excessive Re-renders
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 117-135)
**Issue**: The `moveSnake` callback has a very large dependency array, which could cause unnecessary re-renders and impact performance.
**Fix needed**: Split the large dependency array and optimize callback dependencies.

### 8. Game Loop Timing Issues
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts
**Issue**: The game loop uses `setInterval` with a dynamic interval, but changing the interval doesn't immediately take effect - the old interval continues until the next game state change.
**Fix needed**: Implement proper interval management with immediate updates.

## MINOR ISSUES:

### 9. Combo System Reset Inconsistency
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts and hooks/useComboSystem.ts
**Issue**: The combo system resets to 0 when poison is eaten but resets to 1 for normal timeout, which is inconsistent.
**Fix needed**: Make combo reset behavior consistent.

### 10. Score Validation Missing
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts
**Issue**: There's no validation to prevent negative scores, which could happen with multiple poison foods.
**Fix needed**: Add Math.max(0, score) validation for all score changes.

## ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL ISSUES:

### 11. Self-Collision Check Optimization
**File**: utils/checkGameOver.ts (lines 20-25)
**Issue**: The self-collision check iterates through the entire snake body, which is inefficient for longer snakes.
**Fix needed**: Optimize by checking only relevant segments or using a more efficient data structure.

### 12. Food Type Probability Logic
**File**: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 182-192)
**Issue**: The food type selection logic could potentially select the same type multiple times due to nested probability checks.
**Fix needed**: Implement proper weighted random selection.

### 13. Missing Edge Case Handling
**Issue**: Various edge cases are not handled:
- What happens when the game area is too small for the snake?
- Handling of very fast gesture inputs
- Recovery from invalid game states
**Fix needed**: Add comprehensive edge case validation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Restructure collision detection** - Check collisions after calculating new position
2. **Implement food collision avoidance** - Ensure food doesn't spawn on snake body
3. **Add bounds validation** - Ensure game bounds are correctly calculated relative to the actual game area
4. **Optimize re-renders** - Split the large game loop dependency array
5. **Add input validation** - Validate score changes and prevent impossible game states
6. **Improve gesture sensitivity** - Add minimum swipe distance threshold
7. **Implement proper state management** - Use reducers for complex state updates
8. **Add unit tests** - Test collision detection, boundary checks, and game logic
9. **Performance monitoring** - Add performance metrics for game loop timing
10. **Error boundaries** - Add error handling for unexpected game states
