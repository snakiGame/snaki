SNAKE GAME LOGIC ISSUES ANALYSIS
=====================================

CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. Game Over Check Logic Flaw
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 88-96)
Issue: The game over check happens BEFORE the snake moves, but uses the current snake head position. This means:
- The check is performed with the old position, not where the snake is about to move
- The snake could move into a wall or itself and the collision wouldn't be detected until the next frame
Fix needed: Move the collision check after calculating the new head position.

2. Food Collision Detection Issues
File: utils/checkEatsFood.ts
Issue: The collision detection uses an area parameter (set to 2 in the game loop), but creates inconsistent behavior:
- Uses < comparison instead of <=, which could miss exact collisions
- The area-based detection might allow food to be eaten from a distance rather than requiring exact position overlap
Fix needed: Use exact position matching or fix the comparison logic.

3. Boundary Calculation Problem
File: hooks/useGame.ts (lines 21-26)
Issue: The game bounds calculation doesn't account for the actual game unit positioning:
gameBounds: GameBounds = {
  xMin: 0,
  xMax: Math.floor((screenWidth - BORDER_WIDTH * 2) / GAME_UNIT_SIZE),
  yMin: 0,
  yMax: Math.floor((screenHeight - BORDER_WIDTH * 2) / GAME_UNIT_SIZE),
};
This could cause the snake to move beyond visible boundaries since the screen dimensions include status bars, headers, etc.
Fix needed: Calculate bounds relative to the actual game area, not screen dimensions.

LOGIC FLOW ISSUES:

4. Food Spawning in Snake Body
File: utils/randomFoodPosition.ts
Issue: The randomFoodPosition function doesn't check if the new food position overlaps with the snake's body. This could spawn food inside the snake, making it impossible to reach.
Fix needed: Add collision check against snake body when spawning food.

5. Power-up Expiration Race Condition
File: hooks/useGameState.ts (lines 73-78)
Issue: Power-ups are checked for expiration using useEffect, but there's a potential race condition where the power-up could expire mid-calculation, leading to inconsistent game state.
Fix needed: Use a more deterministic approach for power-up expiration.

6. Gesture Handler Direction Logic
File: hooks/useGestureHandler.ts
Issue: The gesture detection might be too sensitive and could register unintended direction changes, especially on small swipes.
Fix needed: Add minimum swipe distance threshold and debouncing.

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:

7. Excessive Re-renders
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 117-135)
Issue: The moveSnake callback has a very large dependency array, which could cause unnecessary re-renders and impact performance.
Fix needed: Split the large dependency array and optimize callback dependencies.

8. Game Loop Timing Issues
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts
Issue: The game loop uses setInterval with a dynamic interval, but changing the interval doesn't immediately take effect - the old interval continues until the next game state change.
Fix needed: Implement proper interval management with immediate updates.

MINOR ISSUES:

9. Combo System Reset Inconsistency
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts and hooks/useComboSystem.ts
Issue: The combo system resets to 0 when poison is eaten but resets to 1 for normal timeout, which is inconsistent.
Fix needed: Make combo reset behavior consistent.

10. Score Validation Missing
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts
Issue: There's no validation to prevent negative scores, which could happen with multiple poison foods.
Fix needed: Add Math.max(0, score) validation for all score changes.

ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL ISSUES:

11. Self-Collision Check Optimization
File: utils/checkGameOver.ts (lines 20-25)
Issue: The self-collision check iterates through the entire snake body, which is inefficient for longer snakes.
Fix needed: Optimize by checking only relevant segments or using a more efficient data structure.

12. Food Type Probability Logic
File: hooks/useGameLoop.ts (lines 182-192)
Issue: The food type selection logic could potentially select the same type multiple times due to nested probability checks.
Fix needed: Implement proper weighted random selection.

13. Missing Edge Case Handling
Issue: Various edge cases are not handled:
- What happens when the game area is too small for the snake?
- Handling of very fast gesture inputs
- Recovery from invalid game states
Fix needed: Add comprehensive edge case validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Restructure collision detection - Check collisions after calculating new position
2. Implement food collision avoidance - Ensure food doesn't spawn on snake body
3. Add bounds validation - Ensure game bounds are correctly calculated relative to the actual game area
4. Optimize re-renders - Split the large game loop dependency array
5. Add input validation - Validate score changes and prevent impossible game states
6. Improve gesture sensitivity - Add minimum swipe distance threshold
7. Implement proper state management - Use reducers for complex state updates
8. Add unit tests - Test collision detection, boundary checks, and game logic
9. Performance monitoring - Add performance metrics for game loop timing
10. Error boundaries - Add error handling for unexpected game states
